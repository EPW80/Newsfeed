# Introduction

At this point in your web development journey, you've learned several back-end technologies, including the following:

- Node.js—a JavaScript runtime environment

- Express.js—a library that facilitates web server features in Node.js

- Sequelize—an object-relational mapper (ORM) that abstracts database tables as models

- Handlebars.js—a template engine for delivering HTML and data together

These technologies all belong to the JavaScript ecosystem, but not every company uses JavaScript for their back-end needs. The Python programming language, for instance, is a popular alternative to Node.js.

## Python's many benefits include the following:

- An intentionally simple syntax

- An active community that boasts many libraries

- A wide range of uses, from machine learning to standalone software

In this module, we'll use Python as the basis for a web server. Instead of building it from scratch, we'll refactor the back end of an app that was originally built using Node.js. The app, called Just Tech News, lets users submit links to tech-related articles, comment on other users' articles, and upvote articles for points.
